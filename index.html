<h2>Heyy Mithuu!</h2>
<p>Varsh here. I know this might sound a little cringe, but had a thought to write this, let this be a note of gratitude.
I’ve never been this close to someone before, not even with someone of the same gender. I’ve always carried a fear of being judged, even by the people I love the most. But unta, that fear never existed, and that means more to me than I can explain.
I know life may take us in different directions, but still my heart will always look for your presence in every special moment. You’ll always be the one I want to share my happiness with.
Thank you for being you, and for being mine in the ways that matter.
Muahhh, pumpkin pie 🤍</p>
